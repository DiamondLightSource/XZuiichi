# Combination of XSCALE iputs

XZuiichi - "the best". Input all XDS files in any order, runs XSCALE on all combinations to find best files to merge for maximum anomalous signal. Can also run in "cut down" mode to systematically remove datasets - good for seeing where radiation damage has knocked out anomalous signal aggregation.
